# Adaptive-Hold-Placement-Algorithm-for-Personalized-Indoor-Climbing-Experiences
This project aimed at developing an advanced algorithm that dynamically generates optimal positions for climbing holds. Leveraging climber experience data, the algorithm tailors each climbing wall's configuration to individual skill levels, ensuring a challenging yet enjoyable ascent for climbers of all abilities.
